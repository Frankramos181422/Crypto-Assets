# Infinity Wallet Crypto Information

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of information from chains and tokens, allowing projects to add their logo, receive custom styles and further information, visible when imported by a user into the Infinity Wallet or other platforms/developers/designers using this repository.

This allows any token to gain additional credibility and a professional feel when manually imported across the ecosystem, while providing them with:
- Custom designed logo of the token [Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/InfinityWallet/Crypto-Assets/main/Cryptos/binancesmartchain/0x2170ed0880ac9a755fd29b2688956bd959f933f8/logo.svg).
- Custom color within the Infinity Wallet.
- Fiat price display for the token within the Infinity Wallet.
- Coin info section themed style in the Infinity Wallet.
- Instantly tradable via DeFi aggragted swaps on ETH, BSC and POLYGON (Coming Soon).

## Documentation

For more information [click here](https://docs.infinitywallet.io/developers-and-projects/listing#token-custom-list-integration) or if you are interested in learning how to be **Whitelisted** to gain **additional benefits**, **awareness/marketing to hundreds of thousands of users** and be **default enabled removing the need to be imported**, see the following [Documentation](https://docs.infinitywallet.io/developers-and-projects/listing#token-whitelisting)

## Submission Fee
Integration only requires a **$500** fee which can be paid in over 20 cryptocurrencies. This is to cover the design costs for custom assets, along with the time/cost to check a project's information. Additionally, it ensures that projects integrating support the ecosystem.

**Note:** If a token wants to update their information in the future, an update request will need to be made. There is a small fee of **$100** required each time an update is requested. This is to better validate the request and cover the time/cost involved in reviewing the project information & merging efforts.
